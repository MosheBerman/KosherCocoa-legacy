/**
 * <p>
 * Description: A Java library for calculating zmanim.
 * </p>
 * The zmanim library is an API is a specialized calendar that can calculate
 * sunrise and sunset and Jewish <em>zmanim</em> (religious times) for prayers
 * and other Jewish religious duties. For a much more extensive list of zmanim
 * use the {@link ComplexZmanimCalendar} that extends this class. This class
 * contains the main functionality of the Zmanim library. See documentation for
 * the {@link ComplexZmanimCalendar} and {@link AstronomicalCalendar} for simple
 * examples on using the API. <br/>
 * <b>Note:</b> It is important to read the technical notes on top of the
 * {@link AstronomicalCalculator} documentation. <h2>
 * Disclaimer:</h2> While I did my best to get accurate results please do not
 * rely on these zmanim for <em>halacha lemaaseh</em>.
